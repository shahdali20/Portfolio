        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Shahad, and I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Al-Qadisiyyah (UOQ).
        I have a deep passion for computers and programming, which began in my first year of college. 
        Initially, I learned C/C++ and basic data structures, then transitioned to Python and JavaScript. 
        Using Django, I built several projects and combined JavaScript with HTML and CSS to develop websites. 
        In my final year of college, I undertook a project titled "An Effective Framework for Medical Image Clustering and Brain Tumor Classification Using Transfer Learning." 
        This project was immensely enjoyable and educational, allowing me to delve into machine learning, deep learning, 
        AI concepts, and specifically image processing methods and preparation for machine learning. 
        Currently, I am pursuing the IBM Back-end JavaScript Developer Professional Certificate and 
        the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer, 
        and I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges.</p>
